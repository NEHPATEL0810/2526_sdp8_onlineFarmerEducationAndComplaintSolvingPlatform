    "description": "With the widespread gradual development of Food Security Reserves of Stocks of Food- grains in the Developing Countries, as a part of the individual country's food security programme, the need for keeping these foods safe is obvious. Much of this grain is being held for periods of one to two years. There is little experience in this relatively long-term conservation of foodgrains in large quantities in the tropical and sub- tropical regions of the world, but it is known that insect, fungal, rodent and bird pests constantly threaten the quality and quantity of the food available in these reserves. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is assisting many countries in the development of their food security programme. One aspect of this assist- ance, to help in the prevention of loss of quantity and quality of the reserve stocks, is the aim of this manual."

    "crop_name": "STORAGE TECHNOLOGY",
    "description": "The first question to ask is what level of storage technology should be used. The technology must be appropriate to the individual country situation, but it is equally desirable to use the best technology available. At the preset time much of the grain stored centrally in developing countries is in sacks and the available technology mainly relies on chemical pest control. The Manual is, therefore, to a large extent concerned with bag storage in conventional structures using conventional techniques, which rely on fumigation as the main method of insect pest control. Standards of practice in these techniques are often quite inadequate for long-term storage and the Manual has been pro- duced to assist the radical improvementsthat are necessary to prevent heavy losses in such situations."

    "description": "in sacks in open warehouses as a method of preserving quality in long-term storage, and it is believed that sealed storage, either as a form of hermetic storage or using con- trolled atmospheres of carbon dioxide or nitrogen, should play a significant part in reserve storage. These \"new\" techniques are after all only developments of storage pro- cedures that are centuries old. Pest control is also potentially more effective in bulk than in bagged grain, whether by insecticide admixture, aeration or by other means. Current changes are generally towards capital-intensive bulk handling and away from labour-intensive bag handling. The Manual, therefore, also looks to these developments, giving guidance on pest control in bulk grain in Chapter 4 and discussing alternative non- chemical pest control techniques in Annex 1."

If these losses are not prevented, there may be a total financial loss of the whole or part of the reserve stocks. In such circumstances the highly damaged grain might be left occupying the reserve store, causing cross infestation of other grain and existing only on paper as a famine reserve. Moreover, once deterioration and loss have occurred corrective treatments cannot restore the quality or replace the loss. Thus a vital objective in the storage programme must be to keep loss at a negligible level from the very beginning. This means aiming for a nil infestation level by the best means available. There must be adequate financial provision for this."
  },
  {
    "crop_name": "Loss and deterioration in storage occur because either the condition of the grain",
    "description": "received into store was unsatisfactory, the storage structures are unsatisfactory or the storage management is inadequate and unfavourable conditions are allowed to develop. Good storage must begin with cereals entering storage in good condition,but, deterioration of the grains may begin before harvest and continue through the harvesting, drying, threshing and transportation stages. In the tropics, grain crops are likely to be infested in the fields by storage insects and the developing infestation within the grain may be carried as a hidden infestation into the store. Fungi and bacteria may attack grains, especially in wet harvesting conditions, and rodents and birds may attack the standing crop leaving damaged grains, more susceptible to attack by micro-organisms and insects in store. Premature harvesting may result in a high proportion of immature grains that, because of their high moisture content, will deteriorate rapidly in store. If harvesting is delayed too long then the mature grain may be attacked by insects, micro- organisms and vertebrate pests and may be physically damaged by cracking through repeated natural wetting and drying."

Cleaning and drying to a safe moisture content will inhibit the growth of micro-organisms and reduce insect infestation. These operations need to be carried out in the best possible way. Furthermore, as described in Chapter 4, consignments must be efficiently fumigated, before going into store, as a general routine measure. Deterioration during storage is influenced by the store design, which affects the storage environment. A store should be structurally sound and waterproof, but this is not sufficient to prevent deterioration. Growth of micro-organisms occurs when grain is exposed to high humidities and the seriousness of insect infestation tends to increase at higher temperatures. Tropical temperatures are typically conducive to maximum biological activity. A well-designed store needs to include features that limit high humidities and temperatures, keep pests out and do not give them ideal conditions in which to breed. Even when the requirements for a good store have been fulfilled, deterioration may still occur if the store is poorly managed. Reservoirs of insect infestation may develop"

The common method of long-term storage in the tropics is in-bag storage in warehouses figure 1. Bulk storage in silos, in specially constructed hermetic stores such as the Cyprus bins or in underground stores, may also be used. However, storage on the floor in flat bulk stores is not recommended for long-term storage, because of the difficulties of turning the grain and of pest control. Silos may be too expensive for reserve storage."

A degree of flexibility may be desirable if the storage must be used sometimes for commodities other than the grain reserves. Warehouses would, in such circumstances, have an advantage over custom-built bulk stores. The main difference between transit and reserve stores is that the former are used more and, therefore, need better access and flooring, whereas reserve stores need better security and better storage conditions. The reserve storage site is also likely to need drying, cleaning and bagging plants. This equipment is not described in the Manual, but that does not imply that such equipment is unnecessary."

    "crop_name": "CHOICE OF SITE",

Access to the site should be adequate, especially during rainy sea- sons, and it should not be prone to flooding, inadequate drainage or earth subsidence. The soil load-bearing capacity should be tested for adequacy. Soil preparation may require the removal of organic material and 'black cotton' soils. Foundations should be proofed against termites, if these pests are likely to occur. Warehouses in tropical zones should be oriented with their long sides facing the prevailing wind or, if there is little or no wind, they should preferably be sited with the long side of the building in the east-west axis and the doors on the north or south facing sides. The stores should be provided with electricity and preferably also water, sewerage and drainage."

    "crop_name": "General requirements",
    "description": "The most suitable structures for long-term bag storage are well-designed, single- storey warehouses with capacities from 500 to 2 000 tonnes (figures and 2). 1 A warehouse or group of warehouses should possess an external fumigation plinth, so that infested produce can be fumigated before entering the warehouse, and a completely separate chemical and equipment store. A separate store for empty bags may also be needed. The warehouse and its outbuidlings should have a security fence. The warehouses should be structurally simple. Local conditions and prices will usually determine the choice between steel or reinforced concrete frames and local or imported materials. Similarly the choice between portal frames and locally constructed, lattice frames will depend on on-site costs and ease of construction. Internal columns are not desirable, but are less of a disadvantage in long-term stores than in short-term stores, where rapid handling is more important. Warehouses must be suitable for produce to be fumigated. In normal warehouses this is achieved by fumigating the stacks under gas-proof sheets, but with greater capital cost special warehouses can be built with gas- proof wall and roof materials and with specially designed doors, vents and openings that can be sealed. These buidlings can be fumigated in their entirety."

Internal junctions. The junctions between floors and walls and between floors and columns should be rounded out with fine-aggregate concrete fillets, cast in situ. All roof-to-wall joints should be sealed with mastic. Walls. All cracks should be filled in. Walls should be rendered smooth with cement plaster, sealed and painted with light coloured paint. Sills and Zedges. These should be kept to a minimum and sloped to reduce accumulation of dirt. Angle iron should be accessible for cleaning. Openings. Openings, such as eaves, may be covered with insect mesh, principally to exclude moths. (It is not usually possible to exclude all insects.)

Bins may be constructed of metal or concrete, depending on availability of materials, cost, bin capacity, importance of moisture migration and gas tightness and availability of con- struction expertise. Capacities of bins vary greatly (50 to 5 000 tonnes), although 500 to 1 000 tonnes would be preferred for long-term storage. Bins are usually placed in rows sharing central conveyors above and below, with common elevators at one end. When built in rows the bins often share walls or are connected by interstitial walls. The spaces formed by joined walls or interstices are also filled with grain. The outer walls should have a light-coloured,reflective surface to keep the temperature down."

    "crop_name": "Aeration",
    "description": "All silos should have aeration facilities. Even if the grain is dry at intake, mois- ture migration and condensation can occur, and unless the grain is moved, aerated or re- dryed, severe mould damage can result after long storage periods. Aeration is not a form of drying. Its purpose is to cool the grain or to reduce temperature and moisture gradients. Bins with flat bottoms may have aeration ducting on the floor or a perforated floor with an air chamber below. Small performations are re- quired for sorghum and millet. Hopper-bottomed bins are not easy to aerate satisfactorily, because an even air flow through the grain is hard to achieve. The ease of emptying of hopper-bottomed bins makes turning the grain simpler. Turning is not a substitute for aeration, but it helps to alleviate the effects of moistur'e migra- tion or condensation by mixing the grain."

The choice between fumigation and insecticide application as a method of control is discussed in Chapter 4, \"Insect Control in Bulk Grain\". In either case, a holding or spare silo will be needed if it is necessary to treat grain already stored or to re-treat such grain with an insecticidal spray or with an aluminium phosphide fumigant. For effective fumigation the silos need to be gas tight. If methyl bromide is the fumigant used, then gas recirculation equipment is also needed. If aluminium phosphide fumigants are used, the tablets, pellets or other proprietary formulation must be added to the grain flow to achieve satisfactory distribution of the gas in bins more than 10m deep (see Chapter 4, \"Insect Control in Bulk Grain\"). This can be done at intake or, if it is done subsequently, then the grain must be turned into another bin. In bins less than 10m deep it is possible to distribute the fumigant sufficiently by the use of suitable probes (see Chapter 4, \"Insect Control in Bulk Grain\"). However, such bins are of small capacity, usually about 400 tonnes or less. A water supply is needed for insecticide application. The bins need not be gas tight, but ancillary grain-handling equipment should be fully mechanized and self-emptying (hopper- bottomed) bins are preferable; especially if the grain may need treatment at discharge or re-treatment during transfer to another bin for further storage. Satisfactory treatment requires a continuous, steady flow of the grain and, for this reason, if flat-bottomed bins are used, they should be equipped with sweep augers or an intervening garner bin should be provided."

Aeration floors and ducts, bin elevators and conveyors must be accessible for maintenance and easy to clean, particularly elevator boots. The installation should provide for dust extraction and grain cleaning and for the use of portable suction cleaners powered by electricity.

Sliding doors are particularly difficult to proof unless they are designed to be very close filling. Door ends should be fitted with a plate that narrows the gap with the floor and the wall to less than 5mm when the doors are closed and extends 1.5m from the floor.

To block entry through corrugations under roof sheets, suitable strips of thin sheet metal can be clipped into \"combs\", attached firmly, comb-side up, to the wall plate and pressed into the corrugations so that the \"teeth\" of the comb block the holes. Rats and mice should be prevented from gaining access to the upper part of a build- ing by fitting metal baffles to all pipes and cables that lead to the roof or window level. In brick buildings or other rough-walled structures, a band of gloss paint around the out- side, below window level but at least one metre above ground, will make the brickwork too smooth for rodents to climb. Rodents may enter buildings through holes around pipes (figure 6), which should be closed with metal or concrete. Electrical conduits should be made of metal and cables should be metal-sheathed or armoured where they enter walls or floors (figure 7) and at other points where they may be exposed to attack by rodents. Exposed timbers, accessible to rodents, should have at least the accessible edges and corners protected by sheet metal. Broken drain covers should be repaired. Warehouses of rubber or plastic are readily penetrated by rodents and should be located away from rodent harbourages and completely surrounded by a rodent-proof fence."

The actual methods employed may depend on the point of inspection, the size of the consignment and whether the consignment is delivered in bags or in bulk. However, any method of quality assessment will involve a number of standard operations as follows: A gross inspection to determine the apparent condition of the grain. Grain that is obviously infested by insects or moulds, for example, may be rejected immediately or allowed to be offered again following a suitable treatment. Determination of the quantity of grain in the consignment, by weight or number of bags, preparatory to selection of representative samples. Selection of primary samples, mixing of these to form a bulk sample and the extraction of submitted, working and sub-working samples (Annex 4). For maize, the working sample is normally 100 to 200 g.

Consequently, samples must be taken in such a way that they are as representative as possible of the whole consignment. First of all, it is important to ensure that all parts of the consignment have equal opportunity of being sampled. For example, on a truck loaded with bags of grain, only those bags forming the top and sides of the load are immediately available for sampling. The outer bags must be moved to provide the bags of grain underneath with the same opportunity to be sampled."

For a consignment of more than 100 bags, International Standards Organisation, Recommendation 950,1969 (E) recommends that the number of bags to be sampled should be approximately equal to the square root of the total number of bags in the consignment. To ensure that the sample bags are randomly selected, the following procedure may be employed. Bags must pass the sampling station in batches, each batch consisting of the approximate square root (n) of the total number of bags in the consignment. If the con- signment is very large, or has to be handled quickly, it may be necessary to empLoy several samplers. The first n numbers within the range to n should be selected, in order, from the 1 random number table. The random numbers should be used in the order they are obtained from the table to extract one bag from each batch for sample taking. Por example, from 600 bags about 25 bags should be taken. If the first two random numbers under 26 selected are 23 and 11 this means that the 23rd bag in the first batch of 25 should be sampled, the 11th bag in the second batch of 25 bags should be sampled and so on through the 25 batches. When minimum weights are prescribed for primary, bulk, or submitted samples, these should never be rigidly adhered to, because the addition or subtraction of grain in order to make samples weigh exact amounts effectively interferes with their representative nature."

For good penetration into a bag, the sampling spear should be 40 to 45 cm long. Shorter sampling spears are not good enough for obtaining material from deep inside bags. More even sampling is achieved with the cylindrical type of sampling spear, although this instrument is harder to push into a bag than the tapered type and tends to leave large holes in bag fabric. Correct and incorrect ways of using the sampling spear are shown in figure 12.

The outlet of the hopper is closed by a bung (stopper) until the operator is ready to commence sampling. When the bung is removed the grain falls through on to a cone, which is positioned to ensure that the flow of grain is dis- tributed equally on all sides. Most of the grain is directed into a bag attached to the underside of the collecting funnel, but some of the grain is trapped by four vents arranged equidistantly around the base of the cone and directed vía a separate spout into a sample container. The size of the sample depends on the dimensions of the vents, which can be altered by interchangeable parts. The produce flow sampler was designed for sampl- ing bags as they are off-loaded from a truck."

At and below the safe moisture content, no appreciable metabolic activity occurs and there is no significant development of moulds or micro-organisms. Insects can continue to develop below the safe moisture content, although at slower rates. The limiting RH for insect development varies greatly between species, and exceptionally may be as low as 30 to 35 percent. Grain with a moi- sture content less than 9 percent is safe from most insects other than Trogoderma granarium. Grain masses have a low thermal conductivity and low specific heat. Unless the heat given off by respiration in moist grain is ventilated, spontaneous heating can occur. Local heating due to the activity of insects and micro-organisms can create a local rise in temperature and moisture content, a \"hot spot\", which may lead to further deterioration and germination of the grain. Sometimes, if there is a temperature gradient in the grain, moisture movements can occur and the moisture content may rise above the safe level in the cooler parts. Therefore, under-dried or unevenly dried grain can create serious problems in reserve storage, and there must be adequate sampling to ensure the true moisture con- tent of every part of the stock is below the safe figure. The rate of deterioration is strongly influenced by temperature and is much slower at low temperatures.

The emerged adult is fully mature and, apart from minor changes in colouring and cuticle hardness, no further development takes place. In an alternative form of development (figure 21), known as incomplete metamorphosis, the immature stages resemble the adult, differing only in minor aspects such as size and the development of the wings.

    "description": "laboratory facilities. One of the best methods, where appropriate, is the use of a suit- able laboratory x-ray apparatus to photograph large single-layer grain samples. AHother is the nin-hydrin technique, developed initially in the USA, but which can be used with a relatively inexpensive apparatus the Ashman-Simon detector), developed in the UK. This is useful for small grains, especially wheat, but less convenient for large grains, such as maize. In the absence of equipment for detecting hidden infestation, two alternative approaches are possible, depending on the previous history of the crop and the priority given to absolute control of pests. One alternative is to fumigate all grain going into the long-term storage, whether or not there is evidence of infestation. The other alternative is to retain the samples taken when the grain was being loaded into store and to keep them isolated at normal tropical temperatures for up to six weeks to see if any insects emerge. It is essential that there should be no possibility of re-infestation in that period, but the containers must not be airtight. The samples should be sieved after about five to six weeks. This assessment should be supported by regular and frequent inspections of the stacks or bulk. The presence of insects within a grain bulk may be detected by the use of a sampling spear (see Chapter 2, \"Sampling Methods\"). Sampling of bags within a stack may be difficult and some shifting of the top layers of bags may be necessary. Signs of the presence of insects may be easier to detect than the insects themselves. For example, a series of temperature records from thermocouples or thermistors (Annex 3) built into a stack or inserted in a bulk can reveal rises in temperature and may warn of an impending infestation before adult insects become obvious. It is useful to have a thermistor carried on a probe, which can be pushed into the stored produce for on-the- spot checking."

    "crop_name": "ARACHNIDS",
    "description": "The arachnids found in stores are spiders, pseudoscorpions and mites. Both arachnids and insects have jointed legs but, whereas insects have three pairs of legs, arachnids have four pairs. The life cycle of arachnids is similar to that of some insects; eggs laid by adults hatch into young immature animals, similar to the adults but much smaller. They develop through a number of stages (in which they are known as nymphs), increasing in size each time they moult and generally becoming more and more like the adults in appearance. At the final moult the adult emerges, equipped with full reproductive organs, and the cycle is repeated. Spiders (Aranea) Many types of spiders are found in stores, where they are general predators on the insects. They are seldom found in the commodity but may be common on the walls and floors or in residues. They cause no damage to stored produce but they are not economically use- ful as predators, because they feed indiscriminately on pests and on other beneficial invertebrates, and are not present in sufficient numbers to exert a major control effect."

Gamasine mites are often found in stores, where they prey on the eggs and immature stages of insect and mite pests. Such mites are generally beneficial in stores, but their pre- sence may indicate that pests are present in large numbers."

    "crop_name": "DETECTION OF MITES",
    "description": "Most mites are too small to be seen with the naked eye and it is, therefore, extremely difficult to detect an infestation when only a few are present. Detection is far easier when there are large numbers of mites present, because they tend to overflow from the commodity and are visible often as a brownish mobile dust at the base of a stack or on the surfaces of bags. Some mites emit a characteristic odour, sometimes described as \"minty\", which may give an indication of an infestation. Confirmation of a mite infestation may depend on a microscopic examination of dust samples collected from the base or surfaces of stacks. The mites infesting stored food commodities generally do not thrive in dry con- ditions, but moisture often encourages them to breed. Particular attention should be paid to detection of mites when conditions are ideal for their development, that is, at moderately high temperatures and high relative humidities. In such circumstances small sub-samples of produce should be carefully examined with a powerful hand-lens or a low- power microscope. If moisture content is high, mites can breed even at low temperatures of about 59C or above. For example, the flour mite Acarus siro will breed down to 39C"

Heavy insect infestations on the surface of stacks may also be attractive. Sacks can be badly damaged by pecking. Nesting may result in bird droppings, feathers and bodies contaminating the foodstuffs, packaging and grain-handling facilities. Nests in guttering and down-piping may cause blockages leading to flooding and water damage to commodities. From a disease point of view, birds are objectionable in food stores. They are hosts for lice and mites, which become occasional pests of humans when the birds nest in (Saimonena) buildings. Bird droppings are liable to infection by food-poisoning bacteria and the diseases histoplasmosis, eryptococcosis and aspergillosis are caused by fungal spores contained in bird droppings. Domesticated poultry are often encouraged by storekeepers, but they should not be allowed in stores, where they may cause many of the problems discussed and they may peck holes in the lower layers of sacks to reach grain.

The control of insects in grain is mainly by fumigation but sometimes the applica- tion of insecticides is preferable (see section on \"Fumigation of Bagged Grain under Gas- proof Sheets\"). The insecticides permitted for use for direct admixture with grain are given in Table 8. The FAO/WHO Joint Committee on Pesticide Residues has proposed maximum residue limits for the insecticides in Table 8, which are consistent with the recommended uses of these insecticides for the post-harvest treatment of grain. These insecticides have fairly general, but not completely universal, acceptance. Until there is a general international agreement, through the FAO Codex Alimentarius Commission, compounds will require approval through country or regional regulation schemes. The insecticides in Table 8 may be used for surface and space treatments as well as for admixture treatments.

The physical sorption of gas to a surface decreases with temperature and is reversible. The purpose of airing periods aftér fumigation is to allow as much gas as possible to leave the commodity and disperse into the atmpsphere. Sorption is generally proportional to boiling point, the higher boiling point fumigants being most strongly sorbed. Sorption removes gas from the space around the commodity, lowering the concentration to a level that may be too low to kill the pests. Therefore, additional fumigant must be used on highly sorptive commodities and dosage schedules for fumigants that are sorbed must vary with the commodity. Sorption also limits the penetration of gases, and this has to be considered when large bulks of grain require fumigation. The reaction products of recommended fumigants with commodities are generally considered to be harmless but taint, changes in texture and loss of viability may occur. This could limit the number of repeat fumigations permissible."

(Equipment made of copper, particularly electrical apparatus, must be removed or protected from exposure to phosphine by a film of wax). The fumigant is not supplied as a gas but as tablets, pellets or powders containing aluminium phosphide (55 percent)ammonium carbamate and waxes. Water vapour in the atmo- sphere reacts with the aluminium phosphide in exposed tablets to produce phosphine. The ammonium carbamate decomposes into the gases carbon dioxide and ammonia, which reduce the possibility of spontaneous ignition of the phosphine. The waxes bind the tablet together and slow the rate of decomposition and evolution of the gas. Some formulations contain magnesium phosphide in place of aluminium phosphide. This is said to decompose more quickly and completely. \"Plates\" containing this formulation are impregnated in a polyvinyl acetate matrix, which regulates the release of phosphine."

    "description": "The temperature and exposure period may be extremely critical with phosphine, and the importance of these factors far outweigh small adjustments that might be needed due to differences in the sorption of phosphine by commodities. The effect of temperature is far more marked with phosphine than with other fumigants and at low temperatures it may not be possible to achieve control. Development stages differ greatly in suscept- ibility, with eggs, pupae and dispausing larvae being generally most tolerant. Longer exposures are much more effective than shorter exposures of equivalent CT product, partly due to the development of insects from tolerant to susceptible stages during the exposure time. Higher temperatures shorten development times and shorter exposures are necessary. Table 11 gives a guide to the concentration of phosphine (mg/1) that must be maintained throughout the given exposure period to achieve 100 percent mortality of all stages at the stated temperature. Actual dosages must be much higher than this to compensate for leakage, sorption and the slow build-up of phosphine. There are minimum effective exposure periods, which cannot be reduced by increasing the dosage, as well as lower limits of effective concentration, probably in the region of 0.02 to 0.03 mg/1 (15 to 20 ppm). There is great variation in the toxicity of phophine to insects. Sitophilus species are much less susceptible than most other insect species and the pupae of Sitophilus spp. are most tolerant stage. On the other hand, with common species of warehouse moths, eggs are by far the most tolerant stage and require a minimum period of four days for fumiga- tion at 25°C. Resistance to phosphine has been noted in the adult and egg stages of Rhyzopertha dominica, but the resistant strain should be controlled at recommended dosage levels."

However, the ideal stacking height will depend on the commodity, the method of stacking, whether mechanically or by hand, and the need to make efficient use of the warehouse space. The maximum size of stack that can be fumigated depends on the number and size of sheets and, in the case of methyl bromide, on the quanti- ties of piping and fittings available. To cover large stacks, a number of sheets can be joined with rolled joints. For the most economical use of sheets, there are certain di- mensions of stack that are suited to a particular size of sheet. Experience has shown that a sheet 18 m x 12 m is the most useful size and is generally preferable on grounds of cost, ease of handling and transportation. The sizes of stacks that can be used with this sheet size to achieve the best effect are given in annex 10. An 18 m x 12 m sheet is generally more suitable than a 20 m x 10 m sheet. However, it may be preferable to order fumigation sheets of a special size to fit a standard stack size. Sheets measuring 20 m x 15 m can be considered for large stacks, but they may be difficult to handle."

About five workers are required to give a 1 neatly folded sheet, with all personnel working in unison. Keep folding the m strip over and over until the central line is reached.

Sheets can be placed on the stack rolled up, or the long strip can be opened out to its full length (figure 55 c), passed up the sides of the stack across the top and one end passed down the other side until a metre length is on the floor. As sheets are 1 usually rectangular, not square, it is important to remember whether the sheet has been folded on the long or the short axis. The sheet should be opened out one section at a time across the top of the stack, working towards the edge where the folded sheet is pushed over and the weight of the sheet carries it down to floor level. The sheet is then opened out to its full extent and the final straightening and laying smoothly on the floor is done. Choosing the right position for placing the sheet initially is very important, as once the sheet is opened it is difficult to reposition it. It should not be necessary to drag or move an opened sheet on a stack, as this can lead to damage of the sheet or collapse of the stack. In many fumigations excess sheet needs to be folded away either on the top of the stack or on the floor, where it is best to use the side that has most space, as it is difficult to fold excess sheet neatly in a one metre gap between a stack and a wall."

Sand snakes should be placed in position around the corner, and the third side should then be smoothed out and weighted with sand snakes. A concertina fold at the corner of the second and third sides should then be completed. Finally, the fourth side and remaining corners should be completed in the same way. When the stack is covered by sheets joined with rolled joints, the procedure is simi- lar, but operators should be positioned on top of the rolled joints to prevent them being pulled apart by the people at the corners.

These edges should then be folded until the overlap is taken up. The fumigation team should spread along the fold so that, working together, the overlap is taken up by rolling as tightly as possible. The rolled joint shall then be clamped with spring clamps at to 2 m 1 intervals and weighted with sand snakes. Indoors it may be possible to manage with clamps on the sides only, but outdoors clamps are needed on the sides and on the top."

If there is sufficient space to operate, more than the minimum 1 m gap between stack and wall, the excess sheet can be opened fully, pulled straight and, after sand snakes have been put in position, folded back over itself. Greater excess lengths, particularly in narrow gaps, should be retained on top ipf the stack. This will require a different technique of folding the sheet. For example, on a three-sheet stack, the two sheets covering the ends should first be put in place and folded back for the rolled joint. rolled central rolled joint fold joint Figure 56 Folding the middle sheet of three joined sheets The third sheet should be folded in the following manner to ensure that when it is 9pened out it exactly fills the gap between the end sheets (figure 56). The sheet is first folded in half and rolled, starting from the folded edge until a measured distance (x in figure 56) from the edge is reached. The doubled sheet is opened out on both sides of this folded centre and both sides are folded from the edges to the centre as usual. When the sheet is placed on top of a stack it can be opened, leaving the centre fold closed, and the edges of the sheet should then be in the correct position.

The space is created either by leaving channels along the stack top or by removing bags to make pits three bags deepy under each jet. The bags removed to make the pits are placed around the pits and over the piping (figure 58). This effectively deepens the pits and keeps jets well away from the sheet, which is very important as many types of PVC sheets are damaged by liquid methyl bromide. It also holds the piping near the jets firmly in place so that they are not displaced during the placing of the sheet. It does not matter whether the jets point upwards or downwards, provided there is at least 0.5 m free space on the deliver side of the jets. Therefore, a jet in piping lying along a channel must point upwards, while a jet suspended over a pit must be pointed downwards.

The cylinder valves should be checked with a halide lamp when taking the cylinder out of store. The amount of methyl bromide applied should be determined by weighing the cylinder before and after application. The cylinder should be placed on a portable platform scale qapable of weighing at least 150 kg or it may be suspended from a spring balance attached to a tripod. Alternatively, the exact amount of methyl bromide required may be transferred by weighing from a large cylinder to a small cylinder. The small cylinder can Lhen be taken to the stack. This avoids moving Che balance, but the small cylinder must be pressurized to ensure effective delivery. Cylinders may have a single outlet closed by a wheel valve (A in figure 61a), with a dip tube to the bottom of the cylinder, or two outlets (figure 61b), of which one outlet has no dip tube and is used for pressurization of the cylinder. The other outlet is for delivery, has a key valve, B, and a dip tube to the bottom of the cylinder. As shown in figure 56, the cylinders need a delivery fitting that incorporates a' Schrader valve, C, a gauge, D, a wheel valve, E, additional to the wheel or key valve on the cylinder, and a filter, F. The filter contains glass wool to prevent dirt and rust from getting to the nozzles. The size of the connecting joint varies with the manufacturer and the fitting must have an adapter suitable for the cylinder. (Some cylinders have a 3/8 inch (1 cm) male thread.) However, apart from the special connection to the cylinder, the rest of the line couplings should be a standard 10 mm. To assist n applying the fumigant, the pressure should be raised to 80 to 100 p.s.i. (550 - 690 kN/m ). This may be achieved by means of a heavy duty car foot pump, although it is preferable to use a compressor. Cylinders with a single outlet can be pressurized through the delivery valve, but not while delivery is taking place. With cylinders having two outlets, the pressure can be kept at a constant level throughot the entire application. The pressure should not be allowed to fall below 40 psi. (275 kN/m .)"

A rapid release of large quantities of methyl bromide can take place if valves are faulty or joints are loose. In this case, the valves must be closed tightly and the sources of leakage attended to. With valve E closed (figure 61), valve A or B should be opened and the pressure checked and increased if necessary. Valve E should then be opened cautiously and a small amount of methyl bromide (about 10 percent of the dose) introduced into the stack. Valve E should be then closed and the whole system checked for leaks. Joints should be tightened, if necessary, and any leakage around the stack sealed off. In the event of an emergency where gross leakage occurs due to breakage or dis- connection of a delivery pipe, the main cylinder valve should be turned off and the team should withdraw. After a period of ventilation, an operator, wearing a respirator, should check that the area is clear with a halide lamp or detector tubes before carrying out the necessary repairs. Methyl bromide leaking from under a gas-proof sheet leads to much higher concentrations at floor level than at the level of the operator's face. This is an added safety factor. When a high concentration is detected at ground level with the halide lamp, there may be enough time to put on the respirator without serious exposure having occurred."

In single pass distribution, the fumigant may be distributed in an air stream passed through the aeration ducts. A more rapid distribution is achieved than with gravity penetration, but uniform distribution may be difficult to obtain because air passes at different rates through different parts of the grain. To avoid wasting fumigant by venting it away with the excess air, either the time taken for passage of air through the grain should be known or the fumigant concentration must be measured. Complete recirculation of methyl bromide maybe difficult to achieve in horizontal warehouses. The dosage of methyl bromide depends on the commodity and the temperature. Dosages are given in Tables 14 and 15. For situations where heavy gas losses are likely, such as single pass distribution, the dose should be increased by 50 percent.

If the store is part of a building complex, adjoining rooms or stores should be kept well ventilated and unoccupied. Heating, and sources of ignition should be put out of operation. Articles of copper or brass should be protected from attack by phosphine, with a coating of wax.

Unless metal bins are of the welded type, all plates and bolt holes must be sealed with tapes and fillers. Eaves must be sealed with padding, foam and impermeable coatings on open-eaved, uncapped bins. Alternatively, gas- proof sheets can be sealed down on top of the grain or over the top of the silo. Outlets must be temporarily sealed with plastic film or tape. A pressure test should be used. It may be useful to have a manometer permanently linked to the bins. Sealed bins must have a pressure-relief valve to prevent structural stress. Methyl bromide fumigation of silos requires closed recirculation. Bins of any depth may then be fumigated. The atmosphere is circulated after introduction of the fumigant until about three complete air changes have occurred. The recirculation system is then stopped. The fans and ducting must be part of the tested gas-tight sealed system to prevent dilution of the fumigant. The recirculation system is also used to aerate the bin after fumigation. Dosages of methyl bromide are given in Tables 14 and 15. Phosphine formulations are generally either probed-in or added to the grain during loading. The former is only suitable for small bins as probing to any depth greater than 5 to 6 m is very difficult. The probing needs to be completed within about one hour and gas masks should be available. In unsealed bins, the top of the grain or the top of the bin must be covered with gas-proof sheet.

The air displaced from the bin during filling will contain some phosphine and it is advisable to test concentrations in the working spaces above the bins and to exclude workers other than those carrying out the treatment, who should be provided with suitable gas masks and instructed in their use. Good ventilation of the working space is essential. It is preferable to com- plete the fumigation of a bin in one uninterrupted operation. Bins 20 m deep have been effectively fumigated with formulations, such as magnesium phosphide plates, placed on the surface of the grain. The advantages of this proce- dure are that the formulation can be applied after the bin has been filled, it is less hazardous to apply and the spent formulation is recoverable. The use of low air-flow rates to assist distribution of phosphine have also been described. The safety of these techniques is still being evaluated. Application of the formulation to the surface of grain in bins requires: (a) a very well-sealed bin so that the gas reaches all parts without leakage; (b) a long exposure time (at least 20 days); (e) a headspace sufficient to allow all the phosphine to accumulate without reaching explosive levels; (d) a low dosage rate (not more than 1 g per tonne); (e) a dry commodity and (f) a white exterior to keep temperatures low and reduce moisture migration.

(Space treatment is sometimes erroneously called \"fumigation\", but this term should not be used as the treatment is quite different to fumigation in the storage sense. In structures that are gas tight and fumigable, insecticide space treatments are unlikely to be required.) Space treatments are particularly effective against flying insects, such as moths, and regular space treatments should be carried out where such insects are a problem. Moths are most active at dusk and this is the best time for the treatment to be applied. Treatments may be applied daily, twice weekly, weekly or at longer intervals, depending on the nature of the treatment, the rate of application and the degree of control required. Some alternative treatments are given in Table 17.

The ready to use baits are more convenient, but generally more expensive and do not permit the variation in bait that may be necessary in some circumstances. The manufacturer's instructions for dilution of the concentrate should be closely followed. A large number of possible ingredients can be used successfully in bait, including barley meal, maize meal, wheat meal, cut wheat and whole wheat and it may be worthwhile to try out new combinations of locally available materials. The continued use of a preparation should be reviewed according to the success obtained. Ground cereals can be directly mixed with most rodenticide concentrates. Dry medium ground or crumbled cereal is often successful and should be tried first. Damp baits are generally more attractive than dry baits and should be tried if dry bait proves unattractive.

However, if the grain is in a store where it is always likely to suffer fairly prompt re-infestation, it may be necessary to space the re-fumi- gation treatments. For reasons of cost and convenience, fumigation may have to be delayed if the store manager deems it safe to do so. If warehouse moths are present, misting or fogging should be carried out (Chapter 4, \"Routine Insecticide Treatments in Stores\"). An obvious source of re-infestation should be dealt with, for example by generous dusting with insecticide in corners or crevices. Store fabric or stack surfaces should be resprayed with insecticide if necessary. The intervals between treatments must depend on the circumstances and the need. About once every six months for spraying of stacks, once every three to six months for spraying of walls and weekly misting might be suitable. Poor grain condition should be dealt with according to the cause (e.g. rain water leakage). It may be necessary to aerate the grain or move it to a different store. If there is evidence of rodent infestation the cause should be sought. It may be necessary to make a thorough survey of the whole area, including adjoining Property, to determine the species involved, its habitats, sources of food and drink and pathways.

The actual exposure time depends on whether the method is to be used for disinfest- ation or for holding grain in a protective atmosphere for a long period. Disinfestation usually takes longer with controlled atmospheres than with chemical fumigants and it may be more difficult to provide the quantities of inert gases that are needed than to provide the much smaller quantities of fumigants that would be required. Tanker supplies of inert gases are generally needed for large storages."

    "description": "Most storage insects will only breed within the range of 15oC to 35oC. Temperatures outside these limits progressively impede reproduction and development and in extreme conditions lead to death, especially at high temperatures. Many storage insects quickly adapt to survival at a slow metabolic rate at tempe- ratures below 150C and several weeks exposure to temperatures below 5°C may be needed to kill some species. In cold climates, stored grain usually cools to temperatures well below those at which insects reproduce and develop, and in bulk grain this cooling can be assisted by forced aeration with ambient air to render it safe from insect attack. Cooling the grain by this method to temperatures of between 4°C and 15°C is a useful measure for retarding infestations because, even if insects are not killed, they cease to breed. Crain below 12.5 percent moisture content can be stored safely for long periods in grain bins equipped with ventilation systems when the grain temperatures are reduced to 10°C to 14°C."

In the tropics, the use of aeration to cool a bulk of grain is not usually possible because ambient daytime temperatures are too high and at night, when the air is cooler, the relative humidity may be very high. This does not necessarily rule out aeration at night but careful consideration of the actual psychrometric conditions, with particular regard to the water vapour content of the air, is essential. Refrigeration units may be employed to chill grain and temperatures 15°C to 20°C below ambient air temperature have been achieved. The rate of chilling is faster in damp grain and the method in temperate countries is primarily used to prevent the development of moulds in damp stored grain. Mites will only be controlled if the temperature is below 5°C. The capital costs of refrigerated cooling are high."

The wheat is heated to 65°C by fluidizing it for three minutes in directly heated air. After the heat treatment the grain is restored to ambient temperature by spraying water onto the surface. The water evaporates and is carried away by the fluidizing air. Extensive tests have shown that this heat treatment has no effect on the milling and baking qualities of wheat.

However, the time interval between treatment and death has also been considered to be a disadvantage of the method. Death may occur from one day to several weeks after exposure, depending on the dose applied, but threshold doses, below those which cause immediate death, may produce immediate and generally irreversible sterility. The susceptibility of insect pests of stored products varies widely. Dosages of up to 50 Krad are considered economic but at these dosages long periods between treatment and death must be expected.

The amount of water vapour in the air is small (of the order of 0.01 g/1) and difficult to measure accurately. Moisture content, the ratio of the amount of water in the sample to the total weight of the sample, is easier to measure."

Round-framed sieves with a diameter of 300 to 310 mm are preferred, although square-framed sieves with sides 300 to 310 mm long may be used. Each set of sieves should be provided with a bottom pan (receiver), for the collection of material passing through the screens, and a lid to prevent spillage during the sieving. Comparability of the results of using hand-held sieves depends primarily on uni- formity in their manufacture and it is essential to use sieves made by a factory Whose products are approved by a standards organization. Itnd=hold sieves should be used in a uniform manner if comparability of results is to be maintained. Firstly, the sieve should be held level in both hands directly in front of the body, with the elbows tucked in to the waist. Secondly, using a steady motion, the sieve should be moved approximately 25 cm to the left and back through the centre position, smoothly 25 cm to the right and returned to the centre position. This sieving operation should be repeated exactly 30 times, taking about 30 seconds to do so. No forwards and backwards or up and down movements are permitted, although a final gentle tap of the sieve will help to clear it of any material hanging from the perforations before the bottom pan is removed. When sieves with slotted screens are being used, it is important to ensure that the long sides of the slots are parallel with the movement of the sieve."

The latter are effective for about three months in reasonably well-closed, unventilated areas. Dichlorvos persists in a treated atmosphere for only a few hours after application owing to rapid adsorption on surfaces and ready decomposition.

This insecticide combines irritancy, repellency, rapid knockdown and kill in a manner unequalled by any other. The mammalian toxicity is low. Natural pyrethrum extract contains a mixture of six esters, the pyrethrins, together with a great deal of non-insecticidal plant extractives, e.g. fatty acids, sterols and terpenes. Pure pyrethrins are not isolated from the extract for commercial use, as the product would be unstable. Pyrethrum is mainly used as a space spray and gives rapid knockdown of flies or moths. It may be applied as an admixture treatment and is effective against bruchids on pulses and against Rhyzopertha dominica on grain. However, it is less effective than the organophosphates against Sitophilus and tribolium spp. on grain. Pyrethrum is rapidly broken down by sunlight and, therefore, is not used as a residual spray on walls. Pyrethum is usually formulated with a synergist (Piperonyl butoxide) at a 1:2, 1:5 or 1:10 ratio. This increases the potency and reduces the dosage needed by blocking the insect detoxi- fication mechanism. The most suitable ratio of synergist to pyrethrum depends on the insect to be controlled. The principal formulation is a 0.3% pyrethrins, 3.0% piperonyl butoxide solution in odourless kerosene or technical white oil for fogging or misting.

    "description": "Table 26 gives a guide to insecticide application rates. The effectiveness and persistence of insecticide treatments depends very much on circumstances, particularly on the nature of the treated surface. Mostorganophosphorus insecticides completely break down within one week on fresh concrete surfaces but persistence may be greater on older concrete. On metal, wood or paintwork the effectiveness may last for three to four months or longer. When insecticides are sprayed on to the surfaces of bags, much of the initial insecticidal effect disappears within one month after spraying. Some of this insecticide migrates onto the commodity, where it may continue to have a protective effect. The organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides are quite stable on dry, cool grain and applied at 10 ppm may remain effective for up to one year. Dichlorvos is less persistent, lasting only a few weeks. On moist, warm grain, however, organophosphorus insecticides are readily broken down. Pyrethrum and synthetic pyrethroids are more persistent than organophosphates on grain provided they are not exposed to direct sun- light, which causes the rapid breakdown of many pyrethroids."

The currently used liquid fumigants vary considerably in mammalian toxicity, but most are toxic to some extent and some sountries ban their use. Liver, kidneys and the respiratory system are most likely to be affected. Symptoms of poisoning include irri- tation of the nose, eyes and throat, headaches , nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, coma and respiratory failure. Illness can result from long-term exposure to small doses or from a single exposure to large doses. Exposure to acute doses may be especially dangerous since the onset of symptoms may be delayed for several hours or days. Threshold limit values (TLVs) and maximum allowable concentrations for short exposures (MACs) are given in Table 27. The alkyl halide liquid fumigants, carbon tetrachloride, ethylene dichloride, ethylene dibromide, trichloroethane and methallyl chloride, may be detected with.the halide lamp. There are also detector tubes (Chapter 4, section on \"Fumigation\") to measure concentrations of carbon tetrachloride, ethylene dichloride, and ethylene dibromide. Liquid fumigants are supplied in 25, 50 or 200 litre drums. The choice of fumigant depends mainly on the depth of grain to be fumigated. The application rates are given in Table 27. Liquid fumigants should be applied with an electrical or engine-driven pump equipped wic.h a discharge hose pipe and coarse jet nozzle. PVC and rubber pipes are unsuitable. The vapour is harmful and the fumigant should be applied from a well-ventilated area. Canister respirators (Siebe Gorman type C or type 0) should be worn. Respirators are not suitable for high concentrations or for prolonged exposure, for which remote or self-contained breathing apparatus is essential (Chapter 4, section on \"Maintenance of Safety\"). Heavy plastic or synthetic rubber gloves may be worn. Smoking must be pro- hibited. (Some fumigants are decomposed by lighted cigarettes and the very toxic gas phosgene, is formed.) After application, the grain surface or bag stacks should be covered with polythene film or orther gas-proof sheeting. The grain should remain covered for at least seven days and be aired for at least a further seven days."

Ethylene dibromide (EDB) Ethylene dibromide (1:2 dibromoethane) is a confirmed carcinogen and widely banned for use on grain. It is corrosive liquid that is very toxic to both mammals and insects.
