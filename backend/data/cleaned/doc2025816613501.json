    "crop_name": "Introduction",
    "description": "In the quiet village of Manpur in Nalanda district, Bihar, lives Mr. Mahendra Kumar Singh. With 25 acres of land and a family of eleven to support, agriculture is not just his occupation — it is his way of life. For years, he followed the same rice-wheat cropping cycle, relying heavily on chemical fertilisers to chase higher yields. But beneath the surface, his soil was weakening, and so was his peace of mind. Rising input costs, declining productivity and concerns about soil health began to weigh on him. \"I was always concerned about the rising cost of farming, the increasing use of inputs, and the gradual harm being done to my soil.\" Mr Mahendra recalls. His turning point came when he met Mr. Amit Ranjan Patel, an Agriculture Coordinator posted in Amawan Panchayat. After listening to his concerns about crop residue burning and rising costs, Mr Patel suggested something simple but powerful — to get his soil tested under the Soil Health Card Scheme."

    "crop_name": "UNDERSTANDING SOIL HEALTH CARD",
    "description": "A Soil Health Card is a printed report given to farmers for each of their land holdings. It shows the condition of the soil by testing 12 key parameters, namely Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulphur (Macro-nutrients); Zinc, Iron, Copper, Manganese, Boron (Micro - nutrients); and pH (Acidity or Basicity), EC (Electrical Conductivity) and OC (Organic Carbon). The scheme helps farmers understand what their soil needs through regular testing and provides guidance every 2 years. Each card gives farmers a clear picture of the nutrient status of their land. It also suggests the right amount of fertilisers, bio-fertilisers, organic inputs, and soil treatments to help them take better care of their soil over time."

    "crop_name": "SOIL SAMPLING AND TESTING PROCESS",
    "description": "• Soil samples are taken from a depth of 15–20 cm using a V-shaped cut, collected from four corners and the centre of the field. • Samples are collected in a grid of 2.5 hectares in irrigated areas and 10 hectares in rain-fed areas using GPS tools and revenue maps. • Sampling is done after harvest of Rabi and Kharif crops, or when there is no standing crop in the field."

    "crop_name": "QUALITY ASSURANCE AND COSTS",
    "description": "• 1% of the samples are cross-checked in referral laboratories for quality assurance. • The central government provides ₹190 per sample to cover costs for collection, testing, soil health card generation, and distribution."

    "crop_name": "CARD VALIDITY",
    "description": "• A Soil Health Card is issued once every 3 years. • The next card in the following cycle captures changes in soil health over time. OBJECTIVES OF SOIL HEALTH CARD SCHEME: • To provide every farmer with a Soil Health Card once every two years. This helps identify nutrient gaps in the soil and improves fertiliser practices. • To strengthen the functioning of Soil Testing Laboratories by building capacity, engaging agricultural students, and linking with institutions like the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and State Agricultural Universities. • To identify soil fertility issues by following uniform sampling methods across states. This also includes designing fertiliser recommendations at the taluka or block level in selected districts. • To encourage the use of nutrient management practices that are based on soil test results. This helps improve how efficiently nutrients are used by crops. • To offer financial support to farmers so they can correct nutrient deficiencies and adopt balanced and integrated nutrient management suited to their cropping patterns. • To train district and state-level officers, along with progressive farmers, so that they can promote the proper use of nutrients at the grassroots level."

    "description": "The Soil Health Card Portal is an online and mobile-based platform created for the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India. It helps generate Soil Health Cards in a standard format that can be used across the country. The cards are available in 22 languages, 5 dialects, and in local units to make them easy for farmers to understand."

    "crop_name": "SOIL TESTING LABORATORIES",
    "description": "As part of the scheme, soil samples are collected from various farms and tested in approved Soil Testing Laboratories (SLT). These tests follow the guidelines set under the scheme. The results are then uploaded to the National Soil Health Card portal. This portal is used to register samples, store test reports and create Soil Health Cards. It also provides fertiliser recommendations and helps track the overall progress of the programme."

    "description": "The Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare set up soil health labs in 20 schoolsin rural areas as part of a pilot programme. Learning modules were prepared for students from Classes 6 to 12, as well as for teachers. The aim is to make students aware about soil health for sustainable agriculture practices. These were shared with schools to support the training process. Both students and teachers were trained to collect soil samples, carry out tests, and generate Soil Health Cards using a mobile app developed specially for this programme. School students collected the soil, tested it in the lab, and created the health cards. They also played a key role in sharing the recommendations of these cards with farmers, helping them understand how to use fertilisers wisely and choose the right crops. As of 24th July 2025, 1,021 schools implementing the School Soil Health Programme, with 1,000 soil testing labs set up and 132,525 students enrolled."

    "crop_name": "CONCLUSION",
    "description": "The Soil Health Card Scheme has transformed how farmers think about their land. It has brought scientific understanding into hands of millions of farmers, helping them make better decisions and improve their livelihoods. The data-driven approach of the scheme has reduced input costs, boosted productivity, and promoted long-term soil care. By connecting testing labs, digital tools, schools, and communities, the scheme has created a robust system that puts the farmer at the centre. As India moves towards climate-resilient and sustainable agriculture, the Soil Health Card Scheme remainsa model of how data, awareness, and grassroots support can together lead to real change. Continued investment and innovation under the scheme will be key to building a future where Indian soils stay fertile, healthy, and productive for generations to come.
