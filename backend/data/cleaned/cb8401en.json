    "description": "In 2001, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) agreed to develop specifications for pesticides jointly, thus providing unique, robust and universally applicable standards for pesticide quality. This joint programme is based on a Memorandum of Understanding between the two Organizations. This 2021 second edition of the Manual on development and use of FAO and WHO specifications for pesticides, which is only available online, supersedes the March 2020 third revision of the first edition and previous manuals and guidance documents published by either FAO or WHO on this subject. This Manual provides the standard process, unified requirements and procedures, harmonized definitions and nomenclature, technical guidelines and standards applicable to pesticides for use in agriculture and public health. FAO and WHO specifications for pesticides based on this manual are developed through the FAO/ WHO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Specifications (JMPS) and published on the web sites of the two Organizations. www.fao.org/pest-and-pesticide-management/guidelines-standards/faowho-joint- meeting-on-pesticide-management-jmpm/en and https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vector-control-products/who-specifications- pesticides FAO/WHO specifications apply only to the products of manufacturers whose technical materials have been evaluated. The specifications may be used to provide an international point of reference against which the quality of products can be judged, either for regulatory purposes or in commercial dealings, thereby helping to prevent the trade, sale and use of inferior quality pesticide products. Thus, the specifications will enhance confidence in the purchase and use of pesticides, and at the same time contribute towards better pest control, sound agricultural production, effective vector control measures and improved user, public and environmental safety throughout the world, especially in developing countries."

The term of “chemical pesticide” is considered to embrace inorganic and organic- synthetical active ingredients in any form, irrespective of whether, or to what extent, they have been formulated for application. The term is usually associated with materials intended to kill or control pests (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, etc.) but, for the present purposes, it also embraces certain materials used to modify the behaviour or physiology of pests (e.g. insect repellents and synergists) or of crops during production or storage (herbicide safeners, germination inhibitors)."

The corresponding products of other manufacturers may be submitted for assessment to ensure that existing FAO/WHO specifications are applicable to them. The specifications encompass the physical appearance of the material, its content of active ingredient and any relevant impurities, and its physical and chemical properties, and stability in storage. The specifications do not encompass the chemical characteristics of the formulants, other than where they influence the physical characteristics (which are taken to include characteristics such as pH, acidity and alkalinity). The specifications do not include clauses which define the fundamental properties of the active ingredient, and this includes the efficacy of the pesticide. Data on the efficacy of pesticides are not evaluated by the JMPS. FAO specifications for agricultural pesticides are developed only after registration by the manufacturer in one or more countries and the efficacy of these pesticides is usually inferred from this evidence. However, the efficacy of the active ingredient and formulations of public health pesticides may be assessed by WHO. WHO specifications may be developed for technical materials and formulations prior to any country registration. WHO specifications for formulations are published, in conjunction with the successful prequalification of a formulated product. FAO/WHO specifications are intended for quality assurance and risk management. The evaluation of the hazards and risks associated with pesticides for specifications purposes is based primarily on the assessment of the national registration authorities, and is carried out by a WHO-designated unit or other international organization. In the absence of evaluation by bodies such as a national registration authority, JMPR/Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) or WHO/International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), WHO/FAO arranges a detailed assessment of original studies before the JMPS proceeds with the development of specifications.

The proposal was accepted by the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues in 2001. The procedure enables the JMPR to take account of the impurities, especially relevant impurities, in its evaluations. Ideally, the JMPR and JMPS evaluations should be conducted in the same year, because this ensures comparability of data provided and minimises duplication of effort in providing the data. FAO and WHO recognized that it would take several years to harmonize the JMPS and JMPR agendas for this purpose. Because food safety is the main concern of JMPR, it may not always be possible to align the priorities of JMPR and JMPS, especially for pesticides not used in agriculture. In its 2005 report, the JMPR requested clarification of JMPS activities in the area of hazard and risk evaluation, to avoid possible duplication of effort. JMPS 3"

FAO/WHO specifications are intended to enhance confidence in the purchase and use of pesticides and thus to contribute to human and environmental safety, as well as to more sustainable agricultural production and improved public health.

Specifications developed under the FAO \"old procedure\" (cf. Section \"Background to FAO and WHO specifications for pesticides,\" pp. IX onward) are reviewed at intervals based on suitable criteria like whether the compounds are still in use. The data requirements as outlined in Section 3.1 applies for conversion of old procedure specifications into new ones. However, some particular aspects different than for the proposal of reference specifications for technical and formulated pesticides are considered by JMPS. For the conversion process, the manufacturer providing the most complete hazard data package (see Section 3.1 A.9) supporting a recent purity and impurity profile of the technical material produced is considered by JMPS as main data proposer and the specifications developed are considered as reference specifications. In cases where such a firm link between a full hazard data and the purity and impurity profile of a technical material cannot be established by a manufacturer, JMPS will consider a proposal from a manufacturer submitting a data package similar as for an equivalence case (see Section 3.2, Minimum data requirements for extension of an existing TC/TK specification to an additional manufacturer or a new manufacturing route, point E.1 for Tier-1). The JMPS will, in addition to the data submitted, consider the published subchronic, chronic, mutagenicity, neurotoxicity and reproduction toxicity studies on the active ingredient and their results that have been reviewed and evaluated by JMPR. A proposal for a TC or TK is deemed acceptable by JMPS provided that: in-vitro (i) The technical material under evaluation does not produce a response in the mutagenicity test worse than that for the material whose hazard profile has been evaluated by JMPR; (ii) No qualitatively new adverse effect is observed in the repeated dose studies (28 or 90 days repeated dose studies in rodents); and (iii) The “no observed adverse effect level” (NOAEL) or bench-mark dose for -0.5 any toxicity end point is not more than a factor of 10 lower than that evaluated for the technical material evaluated and published by JMPR. 2.7.2 Review of specifications developed under new procedure Specifications will be reviewed at intervals, according to the priorities outlined in Section 3.6 of this manual.

D.3 Criteria for designating impurities as relevant or non-relevant The decision on the relevance of an impurity is the result of case-by-case scientific judgement. As a default, an impurity becomes relevant when its concentration in the TC equals or exceeds 10% of the maximal acceptable limit as outlined in Section D.2.1. Therefore, the threshold for relevance for skin and eye irritants, sensitizing chemicals, mutagens, carcinogens, and reproductive toxicants depend on the GHS Category. Examples of threshold limits for relevance are provided hereafter: (i) for skin and eye irritants : 1 g/kg for Cat. 1; (ii) for sensitizing chemicals : 0.1 g/kg for Cat. 1A, 1 g/kg for Cat. 1 and 1B; (iii) for mutagens and carcinogens : 0.1 g/kg for Cat. 1A/B, 1 g/kg for Cat. 2; (iv) for reproductive toxicants : 0.3 g/kg for Cat. 1A/B, 3 g/kg for Cat. 2. 50 For chemicals with organ toxicity – as defined e.g. by lethal dose (LD ), LOAEL, NOAEL, benchmark dose (BMD) lower confidence limit (BMDL), ADI – relevance is determined as 10% of the maximal acceptable concentration as shown in Appendix H. Whereas the considerations for the relevance or non-relevance of an impurity in technical materials and formulated products is based on hazard considerations and the possible contribution of an impurity to the overall hazard, a different consideration may be required for very diluted formulations and/or for relevant impurities where the limit in the TC is already very low. It is understandable that with lower concentrations of the active ingredient a certain impurity assessed as relevant according to the above hazard assessment might become negligible when diluted according to reasoned risk assessment. Furthermore, the effort and technical difficulty to develop and peer-validate an analytical method to determine the concentration of an impurity increases significantly with decreasing concentrations of the active ingredient in the formulation. 29"

Such notes may include information on the hazard classification of the active ingredient and formulations, such as the flash point, or other properties and characteristics to assist the user, e.g. reference to national and international handling and transport regulations, phytotoxicity and other potential problems relating to the use of the technical or formulated product. In addition, the notes may provide supporting information on test conditions or, in some cases, provide details of the test methods. However, in most cases, the specifications simply give references to the test methods to be used. Technical grade active ingredients should be as pure as economically practicable, as this will generally tend to minimize formulation and toxicity problems, as well as those arising from taint, phytotoxicity, etc. In setting standards, the JMPS will take account of the technical problems associated with raising quality but, even where no compelling reasons exist for doing so, the long-term advantages of improving quality will often outweigh the disadvantages."

Certain clauses in the guidelines presented in Sections 5 to 8 may be inappropriate, or additional clauses may be necessary, for a particular specification. Where the need for the clause is clearly dependent upon the active ingredient, proposers should simply state that it is not relevant. Insertion of a proposed clause, or deletion of a standard clause, in draft specifications must be supported by a reasoned case, which may range from a simple explanation to a detailed technical argument with supporting information.

Supporting information should 19 Flash point is an important safety characteristic of many liquid formulations. Under the FAO/WHO old procedure, clauses to limit flash point were included in certain guideline specifications but they were withdrawn under the new procedure. Flash point is usually determined by the solvents used for formulation and is therefore under manufacturing control. However, flash point is a measure of hazard, not of performance, and, as in the case of the active ingredient, the risks are application-dependent. As with other hazards, the JMPS cannot undertake risk assessments and relies upon assessments made by national registration authorities, WHO/PCS, IPCS and FAO/WHO JMPR. Risk assessments relating to the active ingredient can usually be adopted freely* because hazard characteristics such as toxicity are not greatly influenced by climate. In contrast, the risks associated with flash point are dependent upon both climate and the specific uses which are registered and it is difficult to provide global specifications for this characteristic. In cases where flash point is of major concern, a “Note” may be inserted into a specification, drawing attention to the need to adhere to national requirements, but FAO/WHO specifications cannot provide a single, universal limit for flash point. *Note. A criterion for development of an FAO/WHO specification is current registration by one or more competent authorities, implying that the risks associated with one or more uses of the product have been assessed as acceptable in one or more countries. The existence of an FAO/WHO specification does not diminish the need for other registration authorities to assess the risks associated with uses of the product in areas for which they are responsible. 57"

    "description": "A technical material (TC) is an active ingredient isolated (as far as is practicable) from the starting materials, solvents, etc., used to produce it. The isolation process may be simple, for example filtration and drying of a precipitate, or relatively complex. A TC may be prepared from a TK but it may also be diluted, with or without conversion to a salt or other derivative, to prepare a TK. A TC is formulated before use as a pesticide and a salt or other derivative may be formed during the formulation process. A TC is traded between manufacturers and formulators. A technical concentrate (TK) may be an active ingredient which has not been isolated from the materials, solvents, etc., used to produce it, or it may be a minimally diluted TC intended for use in preparing formulations. In some cases it is necessary or advantageous to manufacture formulations from a TK, rather than from a TC. For example, the active ingredient may be unstable in a pure form or an isolation process may introduce unnecessary cost and complexity, especially if the only impurity removed is water. A salt or other derivative may be formed during the formulation process or in the preparation of the TK. Where a TC/TK is intended for application by the end user, it should comply with the formulation specifications appropriate to its physical state. If necessary, TC and TK materials can usually be reworked by manufacturers, to ensure compliance with specifications prior to formulation, and therefore storage stability clauses are not included in these specifications."

Their size and weight is determined by manufacturing and/or use requirements. For some physical tests the tablets must be broken and their fragments be used. Water soluble tablets (ST) are intended for use with conventional application equipment. The active ingredient of STs is soluble in water at use rate. However, water soluble tablets may contain insoluble inerts that disperse in the spray liquid. Soluble tablets are often not coated or highly compacted and possess lower mechanical strength. Such tablets require commercial packaging that minimizes or eliminates mechanical stress during normal handling and transport. Selection of physical tests methods must take into account the commercial packaging of tablets. Certain clauses are not applicable to effervescent tablets. This type of tablets, according to Pharm Eur are \"uncoated tablets generally containing acid substances and carbonates or hydrogen carbonates which react rapidly in the presence of water to release carbon dioxide”. The excess of acid and base will mask possible acidity or alkalinity that are conveyed by the active ingredient or coformulants in the tablet.

    "description": "In addition to the characteristics identified in the guideline below, the potential for loss of droplet mass by volatilization may also be critical for ultra low volume liquid (UL) formulations. If droplet evaporation is too rapid, the proportion of the spray which drifts from the target, and the distance over which drift occurs, may be increased to unacceptable levels. The volatilization and drift that occur in practice are dependent upon the initial droplet size spectrum and the height through which droplets fall, the air temperature and wind speed. Even if the other parameters are reasonably consistent, wind speed, in particular, is usually highly variable even over short distances and periods of time. A degree of volatilization which may be unacceptable for one type of application may be of little or no consequence in another case. It is desirable that a clause to limit losses by volatilization should be included in the specification but, at present, it is difficult to relate a simple measurement of loss by volatilization to the potential increase in drift produced. Industry is requested to produce a method, together with data obtained under controlled conditions, that will allow a meaningful relationship to be established between the results produced and Note for preparation of draft specifications. Do not omit clauses or insert additional the potential increase in drift in various scenarios. clauses, nor insert limits that are more lax than those than given in the guidelines, without referring to Section 4.

    "description": "A micro-emulsion (ME) is a mixture of water, water insoluble and water soluble components forming a visually homogeneous, transparent liquid. One or more active ingredients may be present in either the aqueous phase, the non-aqueous phase, or in both phases. A variety of micro-emulsion formulations may be prepared in which the aqueous phase can be considered the dispersed phase, the continuous phase or, alternatively, where the two phases are considered to be bicontinuous. In all cases micro-emulsions will disperse into water to form either conventional emulsions or dilute micro-emulsions. One of the major benefits of micro-emulsions is that they, unlike other conventional dispersion formulations, are thermodynamically stable. In this respect they are somewhat similar to soluble concentrate (SL) formulations. However, micro-emulsions are often only stable within limited temperature ranges. For this reason particular attention should be given to the directions for formulation storage. 150"

Note 1 All physical and chemical tests listed in this specification are to be performed with a sample taken after the recommended homogenization procedure. Before sampling to verify formulation quality, inspect the commercial container carefully. On standing ZE formulations usually develop a concentration gradient from the top to the bottom of the container. This may result in the appearance of a clear liquid on the top and/or sediment on the bottom. Therefore, before sampling, the formulation must be homogenized according to the instructions given by the manufacturer or, in the absence of such instructions, by gentle shaking of the commercial container (for example, by inverting the closed container several times). After this procedure the container shall not contain a sticky layer of non-dispersed matter at the bottom (if the ZE has flocculated it may not be possible to re-disperse this sticky layer). A suitable and simple method of checking for a non-dispersed sticky layer (“cake”) is by probing with a glass rod or similar device adapted to the size and shape of the container.

Five replicate tests should be conducted on samples taken at approximately equal distances on a diagonal across the netting, taking no sample within 10 cm of a border or seam. In made up rectangular nets, the “diagonal” may correspond to Figure 1. The average of the 5 measurements is calculated. The method to test seam bursting strength is identical to that used to test the fabric, except that 5 replicate tests should be made, with the seam centred on the test head. Up to 5 seams may be tested but, if there are < 5 seams, replicate measurements should be made on 1 or more seams, to provide a total of 5 measurements.

The comparison is made with the reference profile in each case. If the materials can share a common specification, and if the degree of similarity is such that the material(s) produced by the additional manufacturer(s), or the new manufacturing route(s) or sites, present(s) risks that are considered to be no greater than the TC/TK on which the reference profiles are based, the additional/new material(s) can be considered equivalent to the original TC/TK."

Measures need to be taken to ensure that the best possible assessment of scientific evidence is achieved in an independent atmosphere free of either direct or indirect pressures. Thus, to assure the technical integrity and impartiality of FAO’s work, it is necessary to avoid situations in which financial or other interests might affect the outcome of that work. Each expert is therefore asked to declare any interests that could constitute a real, potential or apparent conflict of interest, with respect to his/her involvement in the meeting or work, between (1) commercial entities and the participant personally, and (2) commercial entities and the administrative unit with which the participant has an employment relationship. “Commercial entity” refers to any company, association (e.g., trade association), organization or any other entity of any nature whatsoever, with commercial interests. What is a conflict of interest? Conflict of interest means that the expert or his/her partner (“partner” includes a spouse or other person with whom s/he has a similar close personal relationship), or the administrative unit with which the expert has an employment relationship, has a financial or other interest that could unduly influence the expert’s position with respect to the subject- matter being considered. An apparent conflict of interest exists when an interest would not necessarily influence the expert but could result in the expert’s objectivity being questioned by others. A potential conflict of interest exists with an interest which any reasonable person could be uncertain whether or not should be reported. Different types of financial or other interests, whether personal or with the administrative unit with which the expert has an employment relationship, can be envisaged and the following list, which is not exhaustive, is provided for your guidance. For example, the following types of situations should be declared: 1. A current proprietary interest in a substance, technology or process (e.g. ownership of a patent), to be considered in - or otherwise related to the subject matter of - the meeting or work. 2. A current financial interest, e.g. shares or bonds, in a commercial entity with an interest in the subject-matter of the meeting or work (except share holdings through general mutual funds or similar arrangements where the expert has no control over the selection of shares). 3.

The calculations are based on known concentrations of the active ingredient, and of the 50 impurity in the technical material, and the toxicity (LD , ADI, BMD, NOAEL, LOAEL, etc.) of the impurity and the technical material (TC), (or technical concentrate (TK). The calculations apply the dose-additivity model (SCHER 2011) for the active ingredient and the impurities, as: 1) synergistic effects leading to more than additive effect are exceptional at low exposure et al levels; and 2) IPCS recommendation is that even for response-additive effects, the model of dose additivity be used as the worst case scenario (Meek ., 2011). They are not used for the assessment of the relevance of impurities that are carcinogenic, mutagenic, sensitizing, toxic to reproduction or development, or irritating to the eye or skin (see Section 3.1, D.3). The dose-additivity for a mixture of chemicals can be expressed as: (1) 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑔𝑔/𝑘𝑘𝑔𝑔 𝑛𝑛𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑎𝑎 𝑔𝑔/𝑘𝑘𝑔𝑔 1000 𝑔𝑔/𝑘𝑘𝑔𝑔 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 + ∑1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑎𝑎 = 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 ai imp ai imp where C and C are concentations of the active ingredient and impurities, TOX , TOX TC and TOX the toxicities of the active ingredient, impurities, and the technical material 50 expressed in figures inversely related to the toxic potency (such as LD , NOAEL, LOAEL, ai TC BMD, BMDL).

With the minimum purity of the TC of 920 g/kg, concentration of the impurity of 10 g/kg is possible. Furthermore, the manufacturing QC limit 2 g/kg exceeds 10% of the maximal acceptable limit 10 g/kg, and the impurity is thus relevant. Example 2 50 A biological pesticide has a minimum purity of 200 g/kg. The acute oral LD of an impurity is 2000 mg/kg bw and that of the active ingredient is 1000 mg/kg bw. That is, the impurity is less hazardous than the active ingredient.

With the minimum purity of the TC of 980 g/kg, concentration of the impurity of 70 g/kg is not possible. Furthermore, the manufacturing QC limit 5 g/kg is less than 10% of the maximal acceptable limit 70 g/kg, and the impurity is thus not relevant. 256"

Therefore, the size of test portion to be analysed must be defined in a specification for a blend of solids. The method of calculating expanded tolerances for such blends is empirical, based on what is routinely achievable in practice with careful mixing of component solids which are well matched in size and density, and by the analysis of appropriately sized test portions. The values for B, in the calculations below, are not intended as tolerances for the addition of a component to a blend, though they inevitably encompass such variations.

This is done by analyzing the same set of samples of TC, TK and/or formulated products using the collaboratively validated method and the in-house method and by doing statistical evaluation of the results. This Appendix provides some guidance on analytical bridging studies, yet JMPS expects that a bridging study may lead to delays in evaluating and concluding on a proposer’s data package by JMPS."

    "description": "In 2001, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) agreed to develop specifications for pesticides jointly, thus providing unique, robust and universally applicable standards for pesticide quality. This joint programme is based on a Memorandum of Understanding between the two Organizations. This 2021 second edition of the Manual on development and use of FAO and WHO specifications for pesticides, which is only available online, supersedes the March 2020 third revision of the first edition and previous manuals and guidance documents published by either FAO or WHO on this subject. This Manual provides the standard process, unified requirements and procedures, harmonized definitions and nomenclature, technical guidelines and standards applicable to pesticides for use in agriculture and public health. FAO and WHO specifications for pesticides based on this manual are developed through the FAO/ WHO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Specifications (JMPS) and published on the web sites of the two Organizations. www.fao.org/pest-and-pesticide-management/guidelines-standards/faowho-joint- meeting-on-pesticide-specifications-jmps/en and https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vector-control-products/who-specifications- pesticides FAO/WHO specifications apply only to the products of manufacturers whose technical materials have been evaluated. The specifications may be used to provide an international point of reference against which the quality of products can be judged, either for regulatory purposes or in commercial dealings, thereby helping to prevent the trade, sale and use of inferior quality pesticide products. Thus, the specifications will enhance confidence in the purchase and use of pesticides, and at the same time contribute towards better pest control, sound agricultural production, effective vector control measures and improved user, public and environmental safety throughout the world, especially in developing countries."
