No Feed Back Paddy: Fourfold Technology  The row to row and plant to plant distance maintained at 15-25cm, which helps good aeration and intercultural operation.  The ash of rice husk and rice straw utilized in nursery and rice field which enhances the physical properties of soil.  Green manuring of sunhemp supplied nitrogen to plants and enhances the physical properties of soil.  The use of urea-DAP briquettes released nutrients slowly which fulfilled need of nutrition of plant up to growing stage Soybean : Variety- Phule  The variety matured in 105-110 days with 30-35 qt/ha yield. Sangam  The shape of seed found to be round with medium size and yellow in colour.  The average of pods observed to be 47 per plant with 2.5 seeds per pod.  It is found to be moderate resistance to stem fly, defoliators, pod borer, leaf folder and Bacterial Pustule, Charcoal Rot.  The average protein percentage recorded 41 with 21 percent oil content. Chickpea : Variety Phule  The variety matured in 105-110 days with 16-18 qt/ha yields in rainfed Vikram + ICM situation.  The variety yields 35-40 qt/ha in irrigated situation and 20-22 qt/ha in late sown situation.  The pods grow erected so it can be harvested by combine harvester.  It is found to be resistance to wilt disease.  The average pod size is medium. Blackgram : Variety- AKU-10-  The variety matured in 70-75 days with 10-11 qt/ha yields. 1  Tolerant to Mugbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV) and powdery mildew, Paddy-STCR  The paddy yield has increased with STCR technology Finger Millet-STCR  The Finger Millet yield has increased with STCR technology Onion- STCR  The maximum yield level could not achieve due to light to medium type of soil in Rabi onion. Onion  Good attractive colour  Big bulb size  Higher yield  Low % of joint onion  Good Shelf life Garlic  Good attractive colour  Big bulb size  High pungency Mango  Higher survival Rate 36 | KVK, YCMOU, Nashik | Annual Progress Report- 2022"

    "description": "...Way towards Natural Farming Situation analysis/Problem statement: Tribal livelihoods in the Nashik district have been characterized with the undulated patchy lands, uncertain irrigation facilities. These are family centric small scale farm enterprises & lacks economy of scale. Perceptions that agriculture is an economically unviable proposition are more relevant especially for tribal agriculture resulting in distress migrations from rural to urban areas in the district. Krishi Vigyan Kendra has adopted Behedpada village of Tryambakeshwar tahsil. It is a 50 families’ tribal village having Paddy based farming system. Besides, Paddy farmers are engaged in cultivating Finger millet, Niger, Onion and other vegetable crops. However there was no practice of scientific composting and its use for crops. Almost every family had their own dumping area for the day-to-day animal waste. The decomposition time was 6 months to 1 year and the quality of FYM also was not good. Farmers periodically harvest the compost for application to the crops. But, it was observed that there was huge nutrient loss due to non scientific practice. Plan, Implement and Support:  KVK with group discussion with the farmers, decided to have scientific compost production units for every family.  KVK provided 50 compost beds to 50 tribal families of Behedpada for scientific composting.  Initially, 3 training programmes were conducted to give technical know-how in bio-agent enriched compost preparations.  This was supported with method demonstrations on ‘how to install the beds’ and ‘how to fill the beds’.  Every bed was covered with local sheds made from locally available material to avoid direct contact of sunlight and rains.  KVK provided Azotobacter, PSB, KMB, Trichoderma culture from its own Bio-agent production laboratory to every family.  Enrichment of the compost and fastening the decomposition process was the idea behind providing the culture. Output:  Every farmer is now preparing the compost with animal and farm waste.  The composting process is going year the round with one cycle of 4 month.  Farmers are storing the compost in bags if there is no requirement by the crop or off crop period.  Farmers are harvesting 3 cycles of the bio agent enriched compost in a year.  Farmers are harvesting bio agent enriched compost, 1 ton every cycle and 3 tons annually 1 | KV K N ashik Suc c ess st ory"

These are family centric small scale farm enterprises & lacks economy of scale. Perceptions that agriculture is an economically unviable proposition are more relevant especially for tribal agriculture resulting in distress migrations from rural to urban areas in the district. The typical work of the female agricultural laborer or cultivator is limited to less skilled jobs, such as sowing, transplanting, weeding and harvesting, that often fit well within the framework of domestic life and child-rearing. Many women also participate in agricultural work as unpaid subsistence labor. The percentage of women who depend on agriculture for their livelihood is as high as 84%. Intervention:"

    "description": "programmes especially for the tribal women. Major objective behind this was to provide suitable and sustainable agro-entrepreneurship to the tribal women so that they can earn money while performing their regular activities. KVK selected Oyster mushroom because Oyster mushroom are most preferred ones among the edible mushrooms due to their ability to produce quickly and productively in various media, their versatility and absolute ease of cultivating and their nutritional value especially as a source of protein. Crop residues of their own farm can be used as media for growing the mushroom. Technical knowhow in cultivating mushroom, method demonstrations on sterilizing the media, filling polythene bags, spawn placement skills were provided by KVK to the women. Besides cultivation aspects, KVK is imparting training for processing and value addition of mushroom. The tribal women provided with polythene bags, quality spawn of oyster mushroom to start mushroom production. KVK especially focused on women group, so that they can collectively grow and market it. Process and technology: KVK organizes 3 days residential vocational training programmes. Training on technical aspects of cultivation, hands on practice on filling the beds and preparation of various products/ recipe of mushroom are imparted. The details of last 3 years is as under Year 2020 2021 2022 Total No. of trainings 6 7 9 22 No. of trainee 153 175 209 537 No. of Groups established units 3 5 7 15 No. of individuals established units 5 6 15 26 Since last 3 years total 22 training programmes were conducted by KVK covering 537 tribal women farmers. The trainee women established the mushroom units individually and in groups as well. Total 15 women groups established mushroom production unit of 200 beds per batch, wherever, 26 units of average 100 bed per batch capacity were established on individual basis. 1 | KVK Nashik-I Suc cess s tory"
